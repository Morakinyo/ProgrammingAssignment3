# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Contains the R script, code book and tidy-data text file for the peer-graded assignment.

# Files:
*  Code Book.md describes the dataset and the steps taken to clean up the data.
*  run_analysis.R contains the codes used to perform the analysis described in the following 5 Steps:
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variables names.
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
*  tidy-data.txt is the final output.
