# About the source data

The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at this site: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) 
The data for the project: [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

# About the R script
The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition.

Having downloaded the dataset and assigned each data to variables as shown below:

* features <- features.txt: The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
    + 561 rows, 2 columns

* activities <- activity_labels.txt : List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its labels.
    + 6 rows, 2 columns
* subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt :contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed.
    + 2947 rows, 1 column
* x_test <- test/X_test.txt : contains recorded features of the test data
    + 2947 rows, 561 columns
* y_test <- test/y_test.txt : contains activityId of the test data
    + 2947 rows, 1 columns
* subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed.
    + 7352 rows, 1 column
* x_train <- test/X_train.txt : contains recorded features of the train data.
    + 7352 rows, 561 columns
* y_train <- test/y_train.txt : contains activityId of the train data.
    + 7352 rows, 1 columns

The following steps were followed as instructed

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
* X  is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
* Y  is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
* Subject  is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
* Merged  is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
* mean_std is created by subsetting Merged, selecting only columns: subject, activityId and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Entire numbers in code column of the mean_std replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:
* activityId column in mean_std renamed into activity
* All Acc in the column name replaced with Accelerometer
* All Gyro in column name replaced with Gyroscope
* All BodyBody in column name replaced with Body
* All Mag in column name replaced with Magnitude
* All data set starting with character f in column name replaced with Frequency
* All data set starting with character t in column name replaced with Time

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* TidyData is created by summarizing and taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after using the grouped by function on subject and activity.
    + 180 rows, 88 columns
* TidyData is exported into tidy-data.txt file.
